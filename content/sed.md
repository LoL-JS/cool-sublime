Couple figures, killers call and collect (collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a Mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (no limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yay
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (so I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (about it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (house)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it
